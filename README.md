## 🎯 About This Book

> *"You don't need billion-dollar infrastructure to build powerful AI."*

This book proves that **one person with a laptop, curiosity, and $10/month** can build production-quality language models that solve real problems. What started as lecture notes for a "Generative AI for Science" course evolved through real deployments—geologists analyzing hazard data, legal researchers processing court documents, historians studying archaic texts, and businesses building multilingual support systems.

**This is not an AI research paper. It's a builder's manual.**

## ✨ What Makes This Book Different

| Feature | Description |
|:-------:|-------------|
| 🖱️ | **Click, Run, Learn, Modify** — All code runs in Google Colab. No installations, no expensive hardware. |
| 🧠 | **Understanding Before Optimizing** — Build GPT from scratch first, then learn to customize it. |
| 💰 | **Real Constraints, Real Solutions** — Costs in dollars, training time in hours, specific GPU models. |
| ⚖️ | **Honest About Trade-offs** — When to use small models vs. APIs, local vs. cloud, scratch vs. fine-tuning. |
| 🔬 | **Battle-Tested** — Validated by hundreds of practitioners from research to production. |

## 📖 From the Author

> *"The barrier between 'AI user' and 'AI builder' is thinner than you think. It's not talent or resources—it's understanding and practice."*
>
> *"By Chapter 2, you'll have built a tiny but working GPT model. By Chapter 3, you'll understand why fine-tuning is revolutionary. By Chapter 10, you'll have trained a small but complete modern language model. By Chapter 12, you'll have deployed production systems."*
>
> *"But tools are only as good as the wisdom with which we wield them. Build models that respect privacy, acknowledge limitations, and fail gracefully. Let the AI propose; let humans decide; let ethics guide."*
>
> **— Dr. J. Paul Liu, Winter 2025**
